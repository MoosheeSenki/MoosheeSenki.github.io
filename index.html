        <h2>Here's some info about me</h2>
        <p>My name is Jack 千輝 Warden and I am a Senior at MSU. My major is Games and interactive media which means I create games!
            Specifically I create the art for it. Even more specifically I do 3D envrionmental and prop art. I really like this old
            game called Zangband (I have yet to find a single other person who has heard of or played it...).
        </p>
        <h2>About Zangband</h2>
        <div class="box"></div>
        <h3>=== Creating A Character ===</h3>
        <p>Zangband is a roleplaying game, in which you, the player, control a
            character in the world of Zangband. Perhaps the most important thing
            you control is the birth of your character, in which you choose or
            allow to be chosen various attributes that will affect the future life
            of your character.Character creation, or birth, is controlled through a variety of
            choices as to constraints on the type of character you wish to play,
            followed by a series of random calculations to generate ("roll up") a
            random character matching the appropriate constraints.
            Once your character has been generated, you will be given the choice to
            generate a new character obeying the same constraints, and once you
            have generated more than one character, you can switch back and forth
            between the two most recent characters, until you are presented with a
            character that you feel comfortable with.
             </p>

        <h3>=== Attacking Monsters ===</h3>
        <p>Attacking is simple in Zangband. If you move into a creature, you
            attack it. If you are wielding a weapon (including digging implements
            which are considered to be weapons) when you do so, the damage for the
            weapon is used when you hit a creature. Otherwise, you will attack with
            your bare hands which does minimal damage (unless you are playing a
            monk).
            
            Melee can do more damage per turn than any other form of attack, and
            the basic equipment (a weapon) is easy to find. On the other hand,
            melee only works against adjacent monsters and takes a great deal of
            training and equipment to come into its own deeper in the dungeon.
            Upgrading to weapons with higher base damages is vital but heavy
            weapons are harder to master. You will have to find a compromise,
            depending on class, experience level, and available equipment (use the
            'C'haracter screen to see how various weapons affect your melee skill).
            
            You may wield both a primary weapon for melee combat, and a bow or
            other missile launcher for launching missiles at the same time. Most
            classes will benefit from carrying an assortment of attacking magical
            devices.

        <h3>=== Defending Yourself ===</h3>
        <p>In Zangband, monsters may damage and otherwise harm you in a number of
            ways: in direct melee combat, by exploding next to you, by breathing
            on you and by casting spells. Some monsters referred to as "summoners"
            may not directly harm you but may summon other monsters to do their
            dirty work for them.
            
            Creatures will attack you in the same manner in which you attack them.
            If they move into you, they attack you. Virtually all monsters can
            lower your hit points by means of a melee attack, and if you lose too
            many, you die. Fortunately, this is also the attack most easily guarded
            against (by wielding armor). Each monster has a maximum of four melee
            attacks which may be of varying type, power and effect.
            
            In addition to pure damage, there can be a number of side-effects from
            a monster hitting you. For example, an especially powerful attack may
            stun you wound you. Stunning is cumulative and, if not addressed, may
            eventually result in you becoming knocked out which allows your
            opponent to continue attacking while you lie helpless. Wounds will
            cause you to lose hit points each round until you either die or your
            wound heals. You will slowly recover from any wound except a Mortal
            Wound with time and all wounds can be healed magically.
            
            In addition to cuts and stunning, some monsters melee attacks may have
            other consequences. These include causing you to become blind, scared,
            confused, poisoned or paralyzed. There are many others less common
            effects. Full details of monsters melee ability may be found in the
            section on Monsters (see monster.txt).
            
            Many monsters also have an array of magical spells which they may use
            against you and others can use various breath attacks on you from a
            distance. For example, a red dragon might breathe fire at you. You can
            defend yourself from the side-effects of melee attacks, monster spells
            and breath attacks by searching for armor that is resistant to that
            form of attack.
            
            As you move down deeper into the dungeon in search of better items,
            you will need to steadily improve your defenses against pure damage,
            wounds, stunning, bolts, balls, and breaths of various kinds,
            reductions of exp and stats, theft, and a variety of miscellaneous
            magical attacks.
